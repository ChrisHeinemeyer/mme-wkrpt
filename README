# uw-wkrpt

This is a LaTeX document class to make you life easier when writing
work term reports for the University of Waterloo.

If you do not know LaTeX, please learn! It is not too
difficult to use, and is really quite helpful. You can read the
workreport-sample.pdf file included in this tarball, as well as:
"A not so short introduction to LaTeX2e: or LaTeX2e in 113 minutes": http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/lshort/

You can also find more information on-line.  There is a FAQ
at: http://faq.tug.org and an page listing documentation for beginners
at: http://www.tug.org/begin.html

This class was originally written by Simon Law, and was available at: http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~sfllaw/programs/uw-wkrpt/. That page no longer exists. 

I have made some improvements and updates to bring this class more in line with the current work report guidelines. If you notice any issues or inconsistencies with the guidlines, please let me know, or send a pull request!
